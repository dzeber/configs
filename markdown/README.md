Markdown rendering tools
------------------------

This is a small toolchain built on top of RMarkdown and Pandoc to easily render Markdown as nicely formatted HTML.
It is intended for maintaining notes or docs written in Markdown, as well as previewing Github `md` files.


Features
========

- Simple rendering or previewing can be done via Pandoc
- In order to get fancier formatting features, like a floating TOC in a sidebar, rendering is handed over to RMarkdown.
- A shared YAML file sets default options


Requirements
============

- Pandoc
- R
- The RMarkdown package
